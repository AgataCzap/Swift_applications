Building software iOS applications with Switf, learning along with Codecademy.

I can build some small basic iOS applications with various features, with navigation, 
Xcode tests, Grid view, Form, editing lists, various views that are combined together in View Model,
SwiftUI view, allowing user to store and edit data, welcome and final screens, as well as models unique to each application.
