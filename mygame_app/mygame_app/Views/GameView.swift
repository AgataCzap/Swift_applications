We can use these to show a button at the bottom of the screen after the user guesses an answer. But to do that, we need access to the view model in our QuestionView. We can do just that with an EnvironmentObject.
                            .environmentObjct(viewModel)

//This cleans up nicely! Since we are using the question from the view model, the hard-coded question property is no longer needed. Then, we replace the question logic with our QuestionView and initialize it with the viewModel.currentQuestion. Now all of the logic related to displaying the question and its buttons lives within QuestionView. The GameView is more concise, simpler, and easier to reason about.//
